---

### 4️⃣ [Reflection](./foundational_design_patterns/4_reflection/)
**Iteratively improve outputs through systematic critique and refinement**

One of the four core agentic design patterns (Ng, 2024), reflection enables AI to systematically critique and improve its own outputs.
```python
# Single-shot: 5/10 quality        # With reflection: 8.5/10 quality
input → generate → done            input → generate → critique → 
                                          refine → critique → final
```

**When to use:**
- High-stakes content (code, legal docs, published articles)

[**📖 Learn More →**](./foundational_design_patterns/5_tool_use/README.md)

---

### 6️⃣ [Planning](./foundational_design_patterns/6_planning/)
**Decompose complex goals into structured, executable action plans**

A fundamental capability for agentic systems (Ng, 2024), enabling AI to decompose complex objectives strategically rather than responding reactively.
```python
# Without planning: Reactive, incomplete execution
# With planning: Strategic breakdown and systematic execution
complex_goal → analyze → decompose → plan_steps → execute_sequentially → final_result
```

**When to use:**
- Multi-step workflows requiring orchestration (research reports, data pipelines)

[**📖 Learn More →**](./foundational_design_patterns/6_planning/README.md)

---

### 7️⃣ [Multi-Agent Collaboration](./foundational_design_patterns/7_multi_agent_collaboration/)
**Coordinate multiple specialized agents to solve complex tasks**

Multi-agent systems, highlighted in both the Agentic RAG survey (Singh et al., 2025) and production deployments (LangChain, 2024), enable sophisticated task distribution and specialized expertise.
```python
# Agents as a team: specialize roles + coordinate communication
user_goal → manager/planner → [researcher | coder | designer | writer | reviewer] → synthesize → final_output
```

**When to use:**
- Complex tasks requiring diverse expertise (research + writing + QA)
- Workflows with distinct stages (research → draft → edit → package)

**Key benefits:**
- 🧩 Modularity: build and improve one role at a time
- 🛡️ Robustness: reviewers catch errors / reduce hallucinations
- ⚡ Parallelism: split independent workstreams for speed
- ♻️ Reuse: agents can be reused across multiple products

**Common collaboration models:**
- Sequential handoffs (linear pipeline)
- Supervisor/manager orchestration (hierarchical)
- Parallel workstreams (merge results)
- Debate/consensus (evaluate options)
- Critic–reviewer (quality enforcement)
- Network/all-to-all (exploratory, less predictable)
- Custom hybrids (fit domain constraints)

### 8️⃣ [ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)](./foundational_design_patterns/8_react/) (Yao et al., 2022)
**Interleave reasoning traces with tool execution for adaptive problem-solving**

Originally introduced by Yao et al. (2022) in the paper "ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models," this pattern demonstrates that interleaving reasoning traces with task-specific actions creates superior synergy compared to treating reasoning and acting as separate capabilities.

```python
# Traditional: Direct action without explicit reasoning
user_query → tool_call → response

# ReAct: Explicit reasoning + grounded actions
user_query → Thought (reason) → Action (tool) → Observation (result) →
             Thought (adapt) → Action → Observation → Final Answer
```

**When to use:**
- Multi-step research requiring information lookup and verification
- Complex problem-solving where the solution path isn't predetermined
- Tasks requiring adaptation based on intermediate results
- Debugging and exploratory analysis
- Need transparent reasoning for interpretability

**Key benefits:**
- 🧠 Explicit reasoning traces improve decision quality
- 🎯 Grounded actions reduce hallucinations
- 🔄 Dynamic adaptation based on observations
- 🔍 Transparent and debuggable decision-making
- ✓ Self-correction and error recovery

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ Higher latency (multiple reasoning + action cycles)
- 💰 Increased token costs (reasoning traces + tool calls)
- 🔁 Risk of unproductive loops without iteration limits

This approach, enhanced by agentic capabilities as described in the recent survey by Singh et al. (2025), enables autonomous AI agents to dynamically manage retrieval strategies through reflection, planning, and tool use—transcending the limitations of static RAG workflows.

```python
# Without RAG: Limited to training data
user_query → LLM → response (may hallucinate)

# With RAG: Knowledge-grounded responses
user_query → retrieve_relevant_docs → augment_context → LLM → grounded_response
```

**When to use:**
- Dynamic or frequently updated information (documentation, product catalogs)
- Private/proprietary knowledge bases
- Domain-specific expertise beyond LLM training
- Reducing hallucinations with factual grounding

**Key benefits:**
- 📚 Access to current and proprietary information

**Integrate human oversight and approval into AI workflows**
```python
# Without HITL: Fully automated
agent_action → execute → result

# With HITL: Human checkpoint
agent_proposal → human_review → [approve|reject|modify] → execute → result
```

**When to use:**
- High-stakes decisions (financial transactions, legal actions)
- Quality-critical content (publications, customer communications)
- Compliance and regulatory requirements
- Learning from human expertise

**Key benefits:**
- 🛡️ Safety and risk mitigation

## 🏛️ Standards & Compliance

### NIST AI Risk Management Framework

Organizations deploying agentic AI systems should consider the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and associated guidance:

#### **Core Framework**
- **[NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework)** (January 2023)
  Voluntary framework to manage AI risks based on four core functions: Govern, Map, Measure, and Manage.

#### **Generative AI Profile**
- **[NIST AI RMF: Generative AI Profile (NIST.AI.600-1)](https://www.nist.gov/publications/artificial-intelligence-risk-management-framework-generative-artificial-intelligence)** (July 2024)
  Addresses risks unique to Generative AI, including governance, content provenance, pre-deployment testing, and incident disclosure. Includes catalog of 400+ mitigation actions.

### Compliance Mapping

| NIST AI RMF Function | Relevant Patterns |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Govern** | [Human-in-the-Loop](./foundational_design_patterns/10_hitl/), [Guardrails](./reliability/guardrails/) |
| **Map** | [Planning](./foundational_design_patterns/6_planning/), [Goal Management](./orchestration/goal_management/) |
| **Measure** | [Evaluation & Monitoring](./observability/evaluation_monitoring/), [Adaptive Learning](./learning/adaptive_learning/) |
| **Manage** | [Error Recovery](./reliability/error_recovery/), [Guardrails](./reliability/guardrails/) |

### Key Focus Areas for Agentic Systems

- **Transparency:** ReAct pattern provides explicit reasoning traces for auditability
- **Human Oversight:** HITL pattern enables approval workflows
- **Safety Constraints:** Guardrails pattern enforces compliance boundaries
- **Evaluation:** Monitoring pattern tracks quality and bias metrics
- **Error Recovery:** Graceful degradation and incident response
