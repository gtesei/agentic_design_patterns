> **Transform your AI applications from simple prompts to sophisticated, production-ready intelligent systems.**

A comprehensive, hands-on collection of design patterns for building robust agentic AI systems. Each pattern is implemented with real-world examples, detailed documentation, and performance benchmarks to help you architect scalable, maintainable AI applications.

## 🎯 Why This Repository?

Building AI agents is easy. Building **reliable, scalable, production-ready** AI systems is hard.

This repository bridges that gap by providing:

- ✅ **Battle-tested patterns** used in production systems
- ✅ **Complete implementations** with LangChain, LangGraph, and Google ADK
- ✅ **Performance benchmarks** showing real cost/latency trade-offs
- ✅ **Clear guidance** on when to use (and when NOT to use) each pattern
- ✅ **Production-ready code** that you can adapt immediately

Whether you're building chatbots, autonomous agents, or complex multi-agent workflows, these patterns will accelerate your development and help you avoid common pitfalls.

## 📚 Foundational Patterns

### 1️⃣ [Prompt Chaining](./1_prompt_chain/)
**Break complex tasks into sequential, manageable steps**
```python
# Transform a monolithic prompt into a chain of specialized prompts
input → extract_data → transform → validate → final_output
```

**When to use:**
- Multi-step transformations (data extraction → analysis → formatting)
- Tasks requiring intermediate validation
- Complex workflows that benefit from decomposition

**Key benefits:**
- 🎯 Better accuracy through focused prompts
- 🔍 Easier debugging with visible intermediate steps
- 🔄 Reusable components across workflows

---

### 2️⃣ [Routing](./2_routing/)
**Intelligently direct queries to specialized handlers**
```python
# Dynamic routing based on query classification
user_query → classifier → [technical_expert | sales_agent | support_bot]
```

**When to use:**
- Multi-domain applications (support, sales, technical)
- Specialized model selection (fast/cheap vs. slow/accurate)
- Intent-based workflows requiring different processing paths

**Key benefits:**
- 💰 Cost optimization (use expensive models only when needed)
- ⚡ Performance gains (route simple queries to fast handlers)
- 🎨 Specialized handling (domain experts for domain queries)

---

### 3️⃣ [Parallelization](./3_parallelization/)
**Execute independent operations simultaneously for dramatic speedups**
```python
# Sequential: 15 seconds          # Parallel: 5 seconds
task_a(5s) →                      task_a(5s) ↘
task_b(5s) →          vs.         task_b(5s) → combine → output
task_c(5s) → output               task_c(5s) ↗
```

**When to use:**
- Multiple API calls (search engines, databases, external services)
- Parallel data processing (analyze multiple documents)
- Multi-source research or content generation

**Key benefits:**
- ⚡ 2-10x faster execution for I/O-bound tasks
- 📈 Better resource utilization
- 🚀 Improved user experience through reduced latency

[**📖 Learn More →**](./3_parallelization/README.md)

---

### 4️⃣ [Reflection](./4_reflection/)
**Iteratively improve outputs through systematic critique and refinement**
```python
# Single-shot: 5/10 quality        # With reflection: 8.5/10 quality
input → generate → done            input → generate → critique → 
                                          refine → critique → final
```

**When to use:**
- High-stakes content (code, legal docs, published articles)
- Complex reasoning tasks (logic puzzles, strategic planning)
- Quality-critical applications where "good enough" isn't enough

**Key benefits:**
- 🎯 50-70% higher quality scores
- 🔍 Systematic error detection and correction
- 🧠 Self-improving outputs without human intervention

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ 3-5x higher token costs
- ⏱️ 4-8x longer execution time

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Python 3.11 or higher
python --version

# Install uv (recommended) or use pip
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentic_design_patterns.git
cd agentic_design_patterns

# Set up environment
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env

# Install dependencies (using uv)
uv sync

# Or with pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Your First Pattern
```bash
# Try prompt chaining
cd 1_prompt_chain
bash run.sh

# Try routing
cd ../2_routing
uv run python src/routing_example.py

# Try parallelization
cd ../3_parallelization
bash run.sh

# Try reflection (stateful loops)
cd ../4_reflection
bash run.sh
```

## 🗺️ Pattern Selection Guide

### Choose Your Pattern Based on Your Needs:

**Need speed?** → Start with **Routing** and **Parallelization**

**Need quality?** → Use **Prompt Chaining** + **Reflection**

**Need cost optimization?** → Implement **Routing** to avoid expensive models

**Need both speed AND quality?** → Combine **Parallelization** + **Prompt Chaining**

**Complex multi-step workflow?** → **Prompt Chaining** is your foundation

**Independent concurrent tasks?** → **Parallelization** will give you massive speedups

**High-stakes output?** → **Reflection** is worth the cost

## 🎓 Learning Path

### Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced

1. **Start here**: [Prompt Chaining](./1_prompt_chain/) - Foundation for everything
2. **Next**: [Routing](./2_routing/) - Learn to optimize model selection
3. **Then**: [Parallelization](./3_parallelization/) - Scale your applications
4. **Finally**: [Reflection](./4_reflection/) - Master quality optimization

Each pattern builds on concepts from previous ones, so we recommend following this sequence.
